## International Transfers

Some of our external third-party system providers are based in the United States or other countries outside the UK and EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data. Whenever we transfer your personal data to a country without an adaquacy decision we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to that personal data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

| **Category**                                                            | **Mechanism**                | **Country** |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| Contact Data and Communications Preferences which is stored on Hubspot. | Standard Contractual Clauses | USA         |

A copy the relevant mechanism can be provided for your review on request to the contact details above.

## Data retention

We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for.

For the provision of the Safe People Registry you require an active account, we process your data for as long as you have an account and for 6 months after this. Certain data may be required to be stored for audit purposes, for more information contact [_DataProtection@hdruk.ac.uk_](mailto:DataProtection@hdruk.ac.uk) .

Where we process your personal data based on your consent we process the data until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). For example, where we process personal data for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the data until you ask us to stop and for a short period of 30 days after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your data so that we can respect your request in future.

Where we process personal data for site security purposes, we retain it for 6 months. The lifespan of the cookies we use is explained in our [cookie policy](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/terms-and-conditions/cookies/).

## YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data, including:

- **Request access to your personal data** (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
- **Request correction of your personal data**. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
- **Request erasure of your personal data**. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
- **Object to processing of your personal data**. This enables you to object to processing of your personal data if you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms or if we are using it for direct marketing purposes. [Y](https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/the-right-to-object-to-the-use-of-your-data/)
- **Request restriction of processing your personal data**. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in a number of different scenarios, such as where you want us establish the accuracy of the data.
- **Request transfer of your personal data**. This enables you to request the transfer of your personal data to a third party. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
- **Right to withdraw consent**. This enables you to withdraw your consent that we are relying on to process your personal data. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

More information can be found on the [For the public page](https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/) on the ICO’s website.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact <DataProtection@hdruk.ac.uk>. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country that you reside in or, the country of your place of work or the country where the alleged infringement took place. In the UK, this would be the Information Commissioner, the UK’s data protection authority.
