        Providing SOURSD with a full employment/affilitation history helps Data
        Custodian&apos;s better understand your suitability. Moreover, your
        employment history provides exposure to other research projects, as well
        as public benefit and impact. The more information you provide
        ultimately leads to a far simpler data access approval process.
