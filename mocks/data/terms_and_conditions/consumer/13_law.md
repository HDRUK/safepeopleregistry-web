# 13. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

## 13.1 These Terms are governed by English law. This means that your access to and use of Safe People Registry, and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection therewith (including non-contractual disputes or claims) will be governed by English law.

## 13.2 You may bring any dispute which may arise under these Terms to, at your discretion, either the competent court of England, or to the competent court of your country of habitual residence if this country of habitual residence is within the UK, which courts are (with the exclusion of any other court) competent to settle any such a dispute.

## 13.3 We will bring any dispute which may arise under these Terms to the competent court of your country of habitual residence if this is within the UK or otherwise the competent court of England.

## 13.4 If we direct Safe People Registry to (and/or pursue our commercial or professional activities in relation to Safe People Registry in) the country in which you are resident, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident. Nothing in these Terms, including clause 13.1, affects your rights as a Consumer to rely on such mandatory provisions of local law.
