# 1. UNDERSTANDING THESE TERMS OF USE

## 1.1 These terms of use (the "Terms") describe how you may access and use SOURSD. By accepting these Terms as part of the Account registration process, you acknowledge and agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to any of these Terms you must not use SOURSD.

## 1.2 When certain words and phrases are used in these Terms, they have specific meanings (these are known as “defined terms”). You can identify these defined terms because they start with capital letters (even if they are not at the start of a sentence). Where a defined term is used, it has the meaning given to it in the section of these Terms (or in the section above “PART 1 – BUSINESS USERS”) where it was defined. You can find these meanings by looking at the sentence where the defined term is included ...

## 1.3 These Terms cover access to and use of SOURSD by users acting on behalf of themselves as Consumers in order to access sensitive data on TREs or SDEs for research purposes (a “Researcher”).

## 1.4 When we refer to a “Data Custodian”, we mean a user acting as a delegate on behalf of organisations that manage a TRE or SDE in order to set rules to validate whether a Researcher meets the criteria to access the TRE or SDE that the Data Custodian manages.

## 1.5 In these Terms, when we refer to "you" or "your," we mean you, the person accessing or using SOURSD as a Researcher.

## 1.6 We will only use your personal data through SOURSD in accordance with our privacy policy (available [insert URL]).
