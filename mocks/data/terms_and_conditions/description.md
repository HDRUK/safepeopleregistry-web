We operate the Safe User and Organisation Registry for Sensitive Data tool (**“SOURSD”**) which can be accessed via our web browser at the following URL - [soursd.org](https://soursd.org).

SOURSD is a cloud based web-tool which we provide to validate information provided by Users (either on behalf of themselves as a Researcher or on behalf of a Research Organisation, all as defined below) who wish to access sensitive data held on Trusted Research Environments (**“TREs”**) and NHS Research Secure Data Environments (**“SDEs”**), which are managed by Data Custodians (defined below).

SOURSD is designed to share (a) a Researcher’s profile data with Research Organisations and Data Custodians; and (b) Research Organisations’ data with Data Custodians. SOURSD does not make any decisions as to whether Researchers and/or Research Organisations are considered ‘safe people’ (as defined in the Five Safes Framework) nor does SOURSD make any decisions regarding the grant of access to sensitive data held on TREs and SDEs. SOURSD holds a User’s profile data in a centralised location for convenience purposes only and records the decisions made by Data Custodians.
