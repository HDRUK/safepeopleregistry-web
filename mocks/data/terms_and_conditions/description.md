The Safe People Registry is a cloud based web-tool which we provide to enable validation of information provided by users (either on behalf of themselves as a Researcher or on behalf of a Research Organisation, all as defined below) who wish to access sensitive data held on Trusted Research Environments (**“TREs”**) and NHS Research Secure Data Environments (**“SDEs”**), which are managed by Data Custodians (defined below).

The Safe People Registry is designed to share (a) a Researcher’s profile data with Research Organisations and Data Custodians; (b) Research Organisations’ data with Data Custodians and (c) Data Custodian metadata about projects with Researchers and Organisations. The Safe People Registry does not make any decisions as to whether Researchers and/or Research Organisations are considered ‘safe people’ (as defined in the Five Safes Framework) nor does the Safe People Registry make any decisions regarding the granting of access to sensitive data held on TRE’s and SDEs. The Safe People Registry holds a User’s profile data in a centralised location for convenience purposes only and records the decisions made by Data Custodians.
