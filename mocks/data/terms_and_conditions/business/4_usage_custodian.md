## 4.2 Subject to these Terms, you may access and use the Safe People Registry for the following purposes:

### 4.2.1 to populate data fields in Safe People Registry profile such as data in relation to your Data Custodian, your authorised administrators and your ‘approvers’. An ‘approver’ is an individual who records any decisions made regarding the Researcher’s or Organisation’s ‘safety’ (as defined in the Five Safes Framework) and access to specific projects;

### 4.2.2 to configure automated flags in relation to the criteria for accessing your TRE or SDE (as applicable);

### 4.2.3 to configure manual checks to assess properties of Researcher and Research Organisation profiles against TRE or SDE user validation policies;

### 4.2.4 to populate details about specific projects;

### 4.2.5 to view, analyse, copy, download and export data inputted into the Safe People Registry by Researchers and Research Organisations;

### 4.2.6 to assess the ‘safety’ of Researchers and Research Organisations (as defined in the Five Safes Framework);

### 4.2.7 to notify Researchers and Research Organisations when they have been validated or added to a project;

### 4.2.8 to populate your Data Use Register if you have an account to the Health Data Research Gateway, subject to you having opted to utilise this functionality; and

### 4.2.9 to allow Researchers to sign into your TRE or SRE with their Safe People Registry Account log-in details or digital identifiers,

(collectively, the “Data Custodian Permitted Purpose”).
